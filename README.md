Chunk Scatter
=============

"Chunk Scatter" is a simple tool for analyzing HTTP responses that use chunked encoding. It plots each chunk on a scatter graph to help visualize when each chunk was received by the client. By understanding exactly when and what your server is transmitting, you can optimize server flushing for improved performance.

   Define an alias for each endpoint by adding it before the URL with a comma between them
2. Click 'OK' (or Ctrl+Enter) to generate the scatter graph
3. The y-axis represents the accumulated length of the response in terms of the number of characters
   The x-axis is simply the time in milliseconds since the request started
4. Hover over any point and get a tooltip showing when the chunk was received and the response length at that time
5. You can export the graph as an image by clicking the "Image" link below it
